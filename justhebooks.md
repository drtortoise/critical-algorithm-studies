The reading list has mostly articles and extracts, and my hope is that we can read at least one of those a month, but I also want to read some of the longer works (books! they still exist!). As such I have made a list of just the books from the reading list. There are 25 in total.

The list can be found in this spreadsheet (prices as of 28 Nov 2015): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzJ1sJ2VjFsrfMW2bYT7Tpmpas11Uc7TxgeyzNuMUs4/edit?usp=sharing

I suggest that people have a look at the list and let us know <b> which 3 books they most like to read</b>. Let us know here on github, or twitter (by DM if you don't want to do it publicly). 

Most of the books are published in the US or UK, and we realise it can be difficult and more expensive to get a hold of them in other countries. My tip is to join a library and make use of inter library loans (your librarian will help you). Kindle/ebook versions are often, but not always, cheaper. 

You may also have noticed that most of the books are written by men. Only 4 out of the 25 books had at least one woman co-author or editor. None of the books were written by people of colour. There's one book that is forthcoming that is written by a woman person of colour, Noble, Safiya. [forthcoming] Bamboozled: Identity for Sale in the Age of Google. NYU Press.
